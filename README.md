I'm an aspiring low-level SWE with experience primarily in C, C++ and Python. I'm also familiar with JavaScript and Hack (Meta's fork of PHP). I'm interested in hardware, and like to study electrical engineering and toy with electronics in my free time. I'm currently at Meta as an Apprentice Software Engineer, and am looking to go into embedded systems and low-level development later in my career (kernel, drivers, firmware).
